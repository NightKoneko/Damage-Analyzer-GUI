# HSR Damage Analyzer GUI

Made to be used with https://github.com/hessiser/veritas

This is still a work in progress

## How to use:

1. `git clone https://github.com/NightKoneko/HSR-Damage-Analyzer-GUI.git`
2. Inject https://github.com/hessiser/veritas into the game. This can be done with a tool like https://github.com/lanylow/genshin-utility or Cheat Engine
   * You can download a prebuilt veritas dll from releases or alternatively build it yourself
3. Run `hsrdamageanalyzer_gui.py`
4. Click 'Connect'
5. Enter battle in-game
6. Damage should now be logging and visualizations (graphs) updating accordingly
